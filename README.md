# AdventofCode

## Introduction

Welcome to the Advent of Code repository! This project is dedicated to solving the annual coding puzzles from [AdventOfCode.com](https://adventofcode.com/). Each year, a new set of challenges is released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Feel free to explore the solutions and see how I approached each problem.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each folder contains the solutions for the corresponding day's puzzle.

```
/year
    /day
        solution.ext
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AdventofCode.git
        ```
2. Navigate to the desired year's folder:
        ```sh
        cd AdventofCode/year
        ```
3. Run the solution for a specific day:
        ```sh
        python day/solution.py
        ```
